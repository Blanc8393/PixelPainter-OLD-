**NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT**
PixelPainter2 is now the most up-to date version, consisting of a single HTML file for the user to run in their browser of choice.


This tool converts any image you choose into a image mimicking Minecraft's pixelated painting style. This is intended for use with plugins that allow players to import images to be displayed as maps.
